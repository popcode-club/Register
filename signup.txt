You'll also need to install the following tools before you start joining club meetings.

1. Go to: https://www.python.org/downloads/ Install the latest version of Python.
2. Go to: https://git-scm.com/ and download the latest Git software and install it in your PC.
3. Go to: https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/ and click on the "Download" under "Community" then install PyCharm.

The Git software helps us to share code in PyCharm. We'll discuss how to use Git in PyCharm in our meeting.
